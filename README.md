This application provides basic and comprehensive flight instruments for gliders. It shows altitude, GPS heading, as well as vertical and horizontal speeds. It is possible to record your flight (with the select button).The watch face clearly displays when climbing (rate higher than +0.3 m/s) or when sinking (rate lower than -2.0 m/s). The beep can be activated/deactivated using the menu button (long click on the center left button on the FenixÂ®).

Since recent OS updates, this code is no longer supported by the Garmin platform.
